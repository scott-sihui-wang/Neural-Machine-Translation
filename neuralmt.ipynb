    "#### 1.4.1 Why \\<UNK\\> Replacement?\n",
    "\n",
    "We realized that the \\<UNK\\> token negatively affects the `BLEU` score, because the reference translation sentences contain no $n$-gram terms with such token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many \\<UNK\\> replacement strategies can improve `BLEU` score. As \\<UNK\\> has 0 occurrence in reference translation sentences, replacing \\<UNK\\> with any words that has positive occurrence in reference translation sentences might improve `BLEU` score. So, a simple idea is to remove \\<UNK\\>, or replace \\<UNK\\> with some frequent words in English. Such methods can indeed improve `BLEU` score, however they also lead to worsened translation quality. When \\<UNK\\> is removed or replaced by some random words, the readability of the text decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve `BLEU` score without sacrificing the translation quality, we proposed to replace the \\<UNK\\> token with its corresponding word or words in the original (German) text. This approach has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) it doesn't incur additional information loss. The information in the original text is preserved;\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Many German words and English words share the same `etymological sources` (`origin of the words`), so an English reader can correctly infer some of the German words' meaning (for example, the German word `psychotherapie-patientin` is \"psychological therapy patient\");\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Some of the \\<UNK\\> tokens might correspond to `people's names`, or `places`. In such cases, leave the word as it is might be the correct translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.2 Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the attention mechanism, for each target word, we have computed the alpha vector, which is the target word's relevance to every source words. Now, for the whole sentence with target words $w_{1},...,w_{n}$, we obtained $n$ alpha vectors, $\\alpha_{1},...,\\alpha_{n}$. We can organize all $\\alpha_{1},...,\\alpha_{n}$'s parameters in a matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ so that $a_{ij}$ describes the relevance between the source word $i$ and the target word $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each source word $i$, we compute $p_{i}$, which describes which target word the $i$-th source word is the most relevant to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{i}=\\underset{j}{argmax}\\alpha_{ij}$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we encounter an \\<UNK\\> at position `idx` in the target text, we check all $p_{i}$s to see if there is any $p_{i}=idx$. If so, then the $i$-th source word is the most relevant to the `idx`-th target word and we replace the \\<UNK\\> token in the `idx`-th position by the $i$-th word in the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.3 Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented \\<UNK\\> replacement in the `translate` function before `replication removal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we added an `additional` parameter, `srcFile`, for the function `translate`, so that the `translate` function can get access to the original German text without tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we obtain the `attention` tensor from the decoder. `attention` is a \\[$batch(=1)$, $L_{source}$, $L_{target}$\\] tensor, which captures how each target word is relevant to which part of the source text (that is, `attention`\\[:, :, i\\] describes the i+1 th target word's distribution of attention in the source text, wheras `attention`\\[:, i, :\\] describes how the i+1 th source word is relevant to each of the target word).\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute `focus` from `attention` by `focus=attention.topk(1)[1]`. Each `focus[i]` describes the location(s) of the target word(s) that the $i$-th source word is most relevant to. When we encounter \\<UNK\\> tokens in the target text, we check `focus` the find out which source word(s) is(are) most relevant to this \\<UNK\\> token. Then, we simply replace the \\<UNK\\> token with the word(s) in the original text."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1.5.2 Our \"Ensemble\" of Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In our work, we **didn't** implement the above `ensemble decoding` process. In our implementation, we **didn't** use `ensembling` techniques during `decoding`, instead, we used the \"ensemble\" of models during the `translation` stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have $M$ models, and each of the $M$ models have generated a decoded sequence $O_{i} (1\\leq i\\leq M)$ and a sequence of attention (alpha) vectors $A_{i} (1\\leq i\\leq M)$. What we are doing is to calculate the linear combination of $O_{i}$s and $A_{i}$s:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, $\\lambda_{i} (1\\leq i\\leq M)$ is the weights for the model $i$. Instead of using one $O_{i}$ and $A_{i}$ from a single model, we use the linear interpolation $O$ and $A$, where $O$ predicts the target words at each location, and $A$ predicts which part of the source text is relevant to which target word. Since we don't use linear interpolation in the decoding process, we are **not** implementing `ensemble decoding`. However, use did use a linear interpolation of model predictions to guide the `translation` process, which is why we still think that our approach adopts \"ensemble\" of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation\n",
