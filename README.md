# Neural Machine Translation (from German to English)

## 1. Introduction

In this assignment, initially we are given a `seq2seq` neural machine translation (NMT) network with broken attention mechanism.

Our tasks are:

- Correctly implement attention mechanism for the `seq2seq` network;
- Implement `beam search` as a better decoding strategy;
- Implement any techniques to further improve the `BLEU` scores.

**Topics:** _Natural Language Processing_, _Neural Machine Translation_, _Attention Mechanism_

**Skills:** _Pytorch_, _Python_, _Jupyter Lab_

## 2. How to run the code

## 3. Results
